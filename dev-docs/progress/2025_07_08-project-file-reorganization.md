# Project File Reorganization - 2025_07_08

## What

Reorganized foundational project documents from root directory into structured `/project-docs/` folder with cleaner naming conventions.

## Why

The root directory was cluttered with concept and technical documents mixed with future development files. A clean separation between "what we're building" (project docs) and "how we're building it" (dev docs) improves project organization and makes it easier for future developers to navigate.

## How

Structural changes implemented:

- **Created `/project-docs/` directory** for foundational project documentation
- **Moved `ConceptDocument.md` → `project-docs/concept.md`** (business concept, mission, features)
- **Moved `TechnicalConcept.md` → `project-docs/technical-spec.md`** (architecture, tech stack, implementation)
- **Deleted original files** to prevent duplication
- **Maintained all content** - no information was lost

Directory structure now:

```
MachineDialoques/
├── /project-docs/          # What we're building
│   ├── concept.md          # Business concept & features
│   └── technical-spec.md   # Technical architecture
├── /dev-docs/              # How we're building it
│   ├── README.md           # Development process
│   ├── INDEX.md            # Progress tracking
│   └── /progress/, /decisions/, /implementations/
```

## Challenges

None - straightforward file organization task.

## Testing

Verified:

- All content preserved accurately in new locations
- File structure is logical and scalable
- Names are clear and consistent
- Old files completely removed

## Next Steps

1. Update INDEX.md to reflect the reorganization
2. Begin actual development with technology stack decisions
3. Create project structure (package.json, src folders)
