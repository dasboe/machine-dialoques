# Documentation System Setup - 2025_07_08

## What

Created a comprehensive development documentation system for the Machine Dialogues project with clear structure, templates, and guidelines for future AI developers.

## Why

The Machine Dialogues project is complex with many interconnected components (AI APIs, quality control, databases, etc.). To ensure any future AI can understand, maintain, and extend the codebase, we need systematic documentation of every development step, architectural decision, and implementation detail.

## How

Technical details of the implementation:

- Created structured directory system `/dev-docs/` with three main categories
- Developed comprehensive README.md with exact templates and workflows for AIs
- Established mandatory documentation rules and naming conventions
- Created INDEX.md for navigation and progress tracking
- Set up subdirectories for progress, decisions, and implementations

Key design decisions:

- **Timestamped progress entries**: Ensures chronological understanding
- **Separation of concerns**: Progress vs decisions vs implementations
- **Template enforcement**: Standardized format for consistency
- **AI-focused language**: Clear instructions specifically for AI developers
- **Cross-linking system**: Related docs are interconnected

## Challenges

None encountered - this was a setup task with clear requirements.

## Testing

Verified that:

- All directories created successfully
- README.md contains comprehensive instructions
- INDEX.md provides clear navigation
- Templates are complete and unambiguous

## Next Steps

1. Begin actual project development with core architecture decisions
2. Document technology stack choices in `/decisions/`
3. Set up initial project structure (package.json, basic folders)
4. Create database schema decision document
