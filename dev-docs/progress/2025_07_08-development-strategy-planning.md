# Development Strategy Planning - 2025_07_08

## What

Decided on development approach: "Working Skeleton First" - create a minimal end-to-end implementation covering all core requirements, then iterate and improve each component.

## Why

Machine Dialogues has many interdependent components (AI APIs, quality control, database, scheduler, frontend). Building incrementally risks getting stuck on integration issues. A working skeleton lets us:

- Validate the core concept (AI dialogues) immediately
- Test all API integrations early
- Identify real-world challenges before heavy investment
- Have something demonstrable quickly
- Iterate based on actual usage

## How

**Phase 1: Working Skeleton (2-3 days)**

- Single dialogue generation with 2 AI models (OpenAI + Hugging Face)
- Basic quality control (simple blacklist, text length)
- MongoDB storage with core schema
- REST API with key endpoints
- Simple frontend to view dialogues
- Manual trigger (no scheduler yet)

**Phase 2: Core Features (1-2 weeks)**

- Add more AI models (Grok, others)
- Implement full quality control (cosine similarity, voting)
- Add scheduler for weekly generation
- Multilingual support
- Improve frontend UX

**Phase 3: Advanced Features (2-3 weeks)**

- Manifest system
- Archive with search
- Translation integration
- Advanced visualizations
- Production deployment

## Challenges

Need to balance "working quickly" with "good architecture" - will use TypeScript and clean structure even in skeleton.

## Testing

Each phase will have working demos to validate approach.

## Next Steps

1. Create technology stack decision document
2. Set up basic project structure (package.json, folders)
3. Implement core dialogue generation (Phase 1 start)
