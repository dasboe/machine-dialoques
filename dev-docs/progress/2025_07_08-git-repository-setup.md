# Git Repository Setup - 2025_07_08

## What

Successfully initialized Git repository, connected to GitHub remote, and pushed complete project with comprehensive documentation to https://github.com/dasboe/machine-dialoques.git

## Why

Version control is essential for project tracking, collaboration, and maintaining development history. Having the project on GitHub enables backup, sharing, and future collaborative development.

## How

**Git Setup Process:**

- Initialized local Git repository with `git init`
- Added GitHub remote: `https://github.com/dasboe/machine-dialoques.git`
- Updated `.gitignore` to exclude VS Code `.history/` files
- Staged all project files (24 files, 1771 insertions)
- Created comprehensive initial commit with detailed message
- Resolved merge conflicts with GitHub's initial repository content
- Successfully pushed all work to GitHub

**Commit Message:**

```
feat: Initial project setup with comprehensive documentation

- Complete project structure with Node.js/TypeScript backend and Vue.js frontend
- MongoDB integration and Docker development environment
- Comprehensive development documentation system in dev-docs/
- Technology stack decisions documented with reasoning
- Progressive development strategy planned
- All setup documented following established templates
```

**Repository Structure Pushed:**

- Complete project foundation (package.json, configs, Docker)
- Comprehensive documentation system (dev-docs/)
- Technology decisions with reasoning
- Progress tracking with 4 detailed entries
- Project concept and technical specifications
- Development environment setup

## Challenges

Encountered merge conflict due to GitHub's auto-generated content in the repository, but successfully resolved by allowing unrelated histories merge.

## Testing

Verified:

- Repository successfully created and accessible on GitHub
- All project files properly committed and pushed
- Documentation structure intact and navigable
- `.gitignore` properly excludes development artifacts

## Next Steps

1. Continue with core dialogue generation implementation
2. Set up MongoDB schemas and database connection
3. Implement AI API integrations
4. Create basic quality control system
