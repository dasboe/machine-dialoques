# Technology Stack & Project Setup - 2025_07_08

## What

Created comprehensive technology stack decision document and established complete project structure with package.json files, TypeScript configurations, Docker setup, and development workflow.

## Why

Before building any features, we needed to establish the technological foundation and development environment. This ensures consistent development practices, proper tooling, and scalable architecture from the start.

## How

**Technology Stack Decisions:**

- **Backend**: Node.js + Express + TypeScript for rapid AI API development
- **Database**: MongoDB for flexible AI response schemas
- **Frontend**: Vue.js + Tailwind CSS for balanced learning curve and capabilities
- **Quality Control**: Hybrid approach using external APIs and local checks
- **Deployment**: Docker + Docker Compose for consistency

**Project Structure Created:**

- **Monorepo setup** with npm workspaces (server + client)
- **TypeScript configurations** with strict settings for both backend and frontend
- **Package.json files** with comprehensive scripts and dependencies
- **Development environment** with Docker Compose for local development
- **Environment configuration** template with all necessary variables
- **Comprehensive README.md** with setup instructions and architecture overview

**Key Files Established:**

- Root `package.json` with workspace configuration and unified scripts
- `server/package.json` with Express, MongoDB, AI SDKs, and TypeScript setup
- `client/package.json` with Vue.js, Tailwind CSS, and testing framework
- `server/tsconfig.json` and `client/tsconfig.json` with strict TypeScript settings
- `docker-compose.dev.yml` for development environment
- `.gitignore` comprehensive for Node.js/TypeScript/Vue.js projects
- `env.example` with all required environment variables documented

## Challenges

Minor issue with environment file naming due to global ignore patterns, resolved by using `env.example` instead of `.env.example`.

## Testing

Verified:

- All package.json files have valid syntax and appropriate dependencies
- TypeScript configurations are strict and properly configured
- Docker Compose file includes MongoDB and application services
- Environment template covers all technical requirements
- README provides clear setup instructions

## Next Steps

1. Begin implementing core dialogue generation system
2. Set up MongoDB connection and basic schemas
3. Create initial AI API integration with OpenAI and Hugging Face
4. Implement basic quality control checks
