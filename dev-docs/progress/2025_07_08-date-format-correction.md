# Date Format Correction - 2025_07_08

## What

Corrected all documentation dates from inconsistent formats to the standardized `2025_07_08` format across all progress files, decision documents, and index tracking.

## Why

Consistent date formatting is essential for proper chronological tracking and file organization. The documentation system requires uniform naming conventions for effective navigation and maintenance.

## How

- **Renamed 4 progress files** from various date formats to `2025_07_08-*` convention
- **Updated file content** headers to match new date format
- **Updated INDEX.md** with corrected dates in all tables and links
- **Updated decision document** date to match standard format
- **Verified all links** point to correctly named files

**Files Renamed:**

- `2024-12-19-documentation-system-setup.md` → `2025_07_08-documentation-system-setup.md`
- `2024-12-19-project-file-reorganization.md` → `2025_07_08-project-file-reorganization.md`
- `2024-12-19-development-strategy-planning.md` → `2025_07_08-development-strategy-planning.md`
- `2024-12-19-tech-stack-and-project-setup.md` → `2025_07_08-tech-stack-and-project-setup.md`

## Challenges

None - straightforward search and replace operations across multiple files.

## Testing

Verified:

- All file names follow consistent `2025_07_08-*` pattern
- All internal date references updated
- INDEX.md links point to correct file names
- Navigation works properly

## Next Steps

Continue with core dialogue generation implementation using the established date format.
